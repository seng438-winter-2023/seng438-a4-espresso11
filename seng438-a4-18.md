# Introduction

In this lab we were tasked to perform mutation testing on our previously develoved test cases for DataUtilities and Range classes. We started with 52% and 41% for DataUtilities and Range respectively. We then added more test cases in our classes to increase the mutation coverage and hence improving our test cases.  To do this, we used PitClipse plugin downloaded from the eclipse marketplace. 

In the second part, we were tasked to use Selenium IDE to develop test cases for GUI of our chosen websites. These tests were automated and tested different functionalities of the website and the results were documented.


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

1) Line 147
getCenteralValue() - Substituted 2.0 with 1.0 → KILLED
- The value gets divided by 1.0 instead of 2.0
- The mutant will be killed by any test where the expected value is other than zero as in centeralValueCorrectNegativeNegative()

2) Line 90
Range(double lower, double upper) - removed conditional - replaced comparison check with false → SURVIVED
- The condition changes the comparison (lower > upper) to false
- The mutant should be killed by any test where the lower bound is greater than the upper bound
- It survived in our test cases because we did not have any test where the lower bound was greater than the upper bound 

3) Line 138
getLength() - Incremented (a++) double field upper → SURVIVED
- This mutant increments the value of the upper bound after the test is executed
- As the value of the length is stored before the increment, the mutant does not affect the length and hence survives

4) Line 147
getCenteralValue() - replaced double addition with subtraction → KILLED
- This mutant changes the addition to a subtraction giving the difference of the ranges and not the centeral value
- This mutant will be killed by any non zero range test as in centeralValueCorrectNegativeNegative()

5) Line 138
getLength() - Incremented (++a) double field upper → KILLED
- This mutant increments the value of the upper bound before the test is executed
- As the value of the length is stored after the increment, the value is different from what is expected
- This mutant is caught and killed by any test where the length of a range is being tested as in getLengthValidOutput()

6) Line 165
contains(double value) - replaced boolean return with false for org/jfree/data/Range::contains → KILLED
- The return value is set to false by this mutant
- The mutant is killed by any test expecting a true return as in inLowerBoundary()

7) Line 198
intersects(Range range) - replaced boolean return with true for org/jfree/data/Range::intersects → SURVIVED
- This mutant changes the return value of a valid range to true
- This mutant will be killed by any test testing a valid range and expecting a false answer
- We did not have such a test case hence the mutant survived

8) Line 147
getCenteralValue() - replaced double division with multiplication → KILLED
- This mutant changes the division by 2 to multiplication by two
- This mutant will be killed by any non zero range test as in centeralValueCorrectNegativeNegative()

9) Line 280
combineIgnoringNaN(Range range1, Range range2) - replaced return value with null for org/jfree/data/Range::combineIgnoringNaN → KILLED
- This mutant changes the return value from a range to null
- This mutant will be killed by any test expecting a non-null range as in testCombineIgnoringNaN2NaN1Range()

10) Line 239
combine(Range range1, Range range2) - negated conditional → KILLED
- This mutant changes the condition (range1 == null) to (range1 != null)
- This mutant will be killed by any test where range 1 is not null and range 1 is expected back as in secondRangeNull()



# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

DataUtilities: 

Our initial mutation coverage for the DataUtilities class was 52% with 457/881 bugs killed. After adding more tests for calculateColumnTotal, calculateRowTotal, and Equals, we were able to bring the coverage up to 73% with 640/881 bugs killed. 

Range:

Our initial mutation coverage for the Range class was 41% with 591/1431 bugs killed. After adding more tests for hash, scale, combinedIgnoringNaN and range, we were able to bring the coverage up to 58% with 828/1431 bugs killed.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

In simple term a mutation is injection of bugs (mutants) and mutation testing is finding those injected bugs. When a mutant survives it means that changing the code would not change the result and when it is killed it means that changing the code would change the result. Our goal in mutation testing is to kill the mutants. A mutation score is the amount of coverage; it can be calculated by dividing the number of mutants killed by the test suite by the number of all non-equivalent mutants. There are different types of mutants one of them being equivalent mutants. The behaviour of these mutants does not deviate from the original outcome, so they are not killed by the tests. The mutation score accuracy is inaccurate because of this.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

The mutation score of the test suites could have been improved by creating more tests to kill the mutants. We had many different types of mutants such as increment, decrement, and equality operators. So we could have made more tests that would specifically kill the mutants of these operators.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutation testing is a way of intreoducing intentional faults in the the code and testing out the test suite. Mutation testing is useful because it helps identify weakness in the test suite and a developer can then imporve the coverage with the help of mutation testing. It can also detect bugs early on in the development process making it easier to fix mistakes. It allows the developers to see their mistakes in and fix them. It also helps detect useless test cases hence improving the overall quality of the tests. Mutation testing has some disadvantages as well. It can be computationally expensive as we learned through out this lab, it takes a lot of time to get the results and it requires a lot of computational power as well. If a system constantly runs on high power, its lifetime will decrease and the maintenance cost will go up. Moreover, this type of testing is complex and the developer needs to have an extensive knowledge of mutation testing which makes it harder for the companies to find people. 


# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

As a group we visited all the given websites and decided to choose ikea as it had more functionalities for us to test. We each chose two functionalities and decided to do the testing individually. Then we each came up with different test cases of each functionality and discussed with other group members for opinions. Lastly, we all did our testing on Selenium and compiled our scripts to upload on github. 

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

Verification points allows a user to check if the right results are being displayed on the screen. Moreover, it saves time as the test will fail as soon as it goes to the wrong page. Our gtoup decided to use assertions to make sure that we got the desired results. AssertText allowed us to make sure that the correct data was being given to us. For example, After the login screen, ikea welcomes the user by their name and we used assertText to make sure we were getting this statement if the login passed.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Our team divided the mutation testing into pairs. Iman and Rumaisa compeleted the mutation testing for DataUtilities and added more tests in order to reach the desired percentage of coverage. Muteeba and Shahzill completed the mutation testing for Range and added more tests to increase the coverage. For the GUI testing, the website was choosen by the group as a whole. However, everybody came up with their own test cases individually which were then discussed as a group and completed individually again on selenium. Everbody did the equal amount of work for the report.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

For the mutation testing, initially we were confused because the pit tests were taking longer than expected and we thought that something was wrong with our code. However, we later realised that the test is supposed to take about 10 - 20 minutes to be completed. 

For the selenium testing, the website would sometimes react differently because of the previous tests. We found out that it stored cache and it did not always reset itself before the test. For example, if one test logged a user in, the website would test the next case with the user still logged in which sometimes caused our tests to fail. Instead, we decided to run the test individually, making sure the website was reset everytime. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Running the PIT tests required a lot of CPU power and heated our laptops to above 90C which damages its internal componenets. Moreover, since it took around 20 minutes to get a single PIT summary, it was not possible for us to run the tests everytime we added a new one. This made it difficult because sommetimes one test would increase the overall coverage by 2% and sometimes it would not even impact the coverage. Howerver, on the bright side, we learned two new ways of testing which is going to help us a lot in our future.

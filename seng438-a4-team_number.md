# Introduction

In this lab we were tasked to perform mutation testing on our previously develoved test cases for DataUtilities and Range classes. We started with 52% and 41% for DataUtilities and Range respectively. We then added more test cases in our classes to increase the mutation coverage and hence improving our test cases.  To do this, we used PitClipse plugin downloaded from the eclipse marketplace. 

In the second part, we were tasked to use Selenium IDE to develop test cases for GUI of our chosen websites. These tests were automated and tested different functionalities of the website and the results were documented.
